## ‚öô Tech used
- Apis
- Kotlin
- Model-View-Viewmodel Architecture
- JetPackComponents
- Navigation component
- Room database
- Retrofit 2
- GSON
- Hilt
- Moshi
- Kotlin Courtines.
- Glide.
- Piccaso.
- View Bindings
-Data-Binding.
-SQL-queries.

This app demonstrates the following views and techniques from the below documentation.

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make api calls to an HTTP web service.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) which handles the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects. 
* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) to load and cache images by URL.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for local database storage.
  
It leverages the following components from the Jetpack library:

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding adapters
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments


## Setting up the Repository

To get started with this project, simply pull the repository and import the project into Android Studio. From there, deploy the project to an emulator or device. 

* NOTE: In order for this project to pull data, you no need to add your API Key and please sure the internet connectivity is good.The Api is used without taking the access token which is permissiable but can access to some limit .Please dont panic if you find some error in between, its the Apis sending us :)
* [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
