## ‚öôIntegrating the Jacoco plugin.

After enabling JaCoCo in your project, generate your first code coverage in HTML format. 
The following Gradle command will generate a test coverage report for your project:

- .gradlew connectedCheck

This will generate a report for your unit test alone:

- .gradlew testDebugUnitTest

And this will generate the report for an instrumented test:

- .gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
You can check the code coverage report of your instrumented and unit tests locally. For your instrumented test, locate your Android studio projects folder in your system. Then navigate to your project folder: _(CodeCoverageExample) > app > build > reports > androidTests > connected > flavors > debugAndroidTest > Index.html.

##‚öôFocus is on Testing the application And Status below

- DATABASE TESTING COMPLETED.

- REST API TESTING PENDING.

- ACTIVITY TESTING IS COMPLETED


##‚öô To get started with this project, simply pull the repository and import the project into Android Studio. From there, deploy the project to an emulator or device. 

* NOTE: In order for this project to pull data, you no need to add your API Key and please sure the internet connectivity is good.The Api is used without taking the access token which is permissiable but can access to some limit .Please dont panic if you find some error in between, its the Apis sending us :)
